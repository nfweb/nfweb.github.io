Hello there! On this blog we will periodically report about our process on the Nightfever Web Dev team. Our mission is to build and operate websites and web-based services for [Nightfever](http://nightfever.org).

Most of our source code and documents will be hosted on Github at [nfweb](https://github.com/nfweb) and there are already a few repositories there. So this is allways a good place to see what we are doing.

The first and most important project is the redesign of Nightfever's main website which includes the global nightfever.org as well as dozens of local city sites. As the [Project Brief](https://github.com/nfweb/nfweb-concept/blob/master/project-brief.md) shows, this task is definitely going to require some effort.

We have already held a few presentations on the website project, they are available at [nfweb.github.io/slides](http://nfweb.github.io/slides).
